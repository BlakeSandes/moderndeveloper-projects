**A Shipping and Billing Address Form** for retrieving a customer’s shipping and billing information. Use one form element for both collections. It should have two sections, one with labels and inputs for shipping information, and one with labels and inputs for billing information. Both sections should have the following labels and inputs:

  * First name

  * Last name

  * Address

  * City

  * Country

Also, include a label and checkbox element indicating that shipping should match the billing form’s input data.
